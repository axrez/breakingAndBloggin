# Personal website

Hi there, welcome to my github repo containing my personal website. Feel free to poke around and shoot me a message if you find anything worth improving. The site is live and you can check it out [here](oestergaard.tech). You can also clone the repo and start the locale dev-env: 
```sh
# With yarn
yarn dev
# With npm
npm run dev
```
Cheers!
