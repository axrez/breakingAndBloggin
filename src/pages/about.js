      <p>
        My name is Emil. I'm 20 years old and live in the town of Slagelse. I've
        finished high school this year (the summer of 2019) and will be taking a
        year or two off before university. I would describe myself as engaged,
        curious, responsible, and with a drive to learn. I spend my free time
        running, programming, climbing and playing Magic the Gathering (an
        awesome trading card game).
      </p>
      <p>
        My interest in programming was sparked during my time in high school and
        especially in web-development. React has occupied my attention since in
        the forms of create-react-app, Gatsby and next.js. I've also dabbled in
        the realm of node.js and NoSQL databases such as mongoDB. Lastly, Iâ€™ve
        done some IoT stuff with ESP8266 and ESP32 chips in different school
        projects.
