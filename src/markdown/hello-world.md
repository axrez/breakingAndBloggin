Hi there. I feel like I'm repeating myself at this point but, Welcome. So this is my very first blog post and rather than discuss some technical challenge, I will spend the time to properly introduce myself and the concepts of the blog I hope to start.

My name is Emil. I'm 20 years old, at the time of writing. I live in a small town called Slagelse about an hour west of Copenhagen, Denmark. I'm currently working as a full-time developer, at a company here in the Copenhagen area. I spend 10-15 hours coding besides work and I'm currently in to animations (yay react-spring), Gatsby (which this blog is made with) and automation. 

I spend the remaining time on my hobbies and together with my lovely girlfriend. I like to be physically active and therefore boulder 2 to 3 times a week as well as going for a run 2 times a week. I'm also heavily invested in Magic the Gathering (both mentally and financially, it's called cardboard crack for a reason). For the fellow MtG people out there, I mostly play commander/edh and my favorite color combo is bant. 

Enough about me. I would really like to make this blog a two times a week kinda thing. I will write about whatever I find interesting, tech or not, but most of the stuff will be related to JavaScript and react as an extension of that.

I think that's about it for today, see ya next time!
